Create a student grading system using Python that has the following functionalities:
1. Entering the Grades of a student
2. Removing a student from the system
3. Calculating the average grades of students
The user should be able to select whether he/she wants to remove a student, enter grades for a
student or find the average grades.
Also, perform the following as part of this project:

    There should be a log-in system to allow only admin access to the grading system.
    Make sure you use dictionaries and lists for storing studentâ€™s data.
    Use Python functions as much as you can.
 
 The code includes a login system to restrict access to the system to only the admin, and it stores 
 student data in a dictionary using lists to store the grades. The code also uses Python functions to 
 implement the various functionalities of the system.To use the system, the user will need to enter their 
 login credentials (username: "admin", password: "admin123") and then select an option from the menu to add a student, 
 remove a student, or calculate the average grades of a student. The user can perform multiple actions by selecting 'y' 
 when prompted to perform another action.
